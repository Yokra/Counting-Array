# Counting-Array


Every second, the counter increments by one. The counter is then added to the beginning of an array. The array is “truncated” so that it never becomes longer than 9.
The array is logged to the console. The program doesn’t do anything else.

Design
You should only need two variables, the counter and the array. Only one of them should be a let variable.
You should only need one function, but you might benefit from using the init-loop pattern.

Recommended procedure
Make a program that counts
Modify the program to insert the counter in the beginning of the array
Modify the program again, to make sure the array doesn’t get longer than 9
